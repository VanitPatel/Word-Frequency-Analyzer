# Word-Frequency-Analyzer
 Developed a word frequency analysis program using a custom Hashed Dictionary ADT with open addressing and linear probing
• Implemented dictionary operation (add, getValue, getKeyIterator) and tracked hash table collisions to analyze performance across varying table sizes.
• Processed textual input to count and display unique word frequencies.
• Applied hashing algorithms, data structures, and iterative design to achieve robust word frequency
